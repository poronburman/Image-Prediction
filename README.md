# Image Prediction

1. This project uses Convolutional Neural Network to predict whether an image is a cat or a dog. 

2. This analysis can be used to accurately classify 2D images.

3. The convolutional neural network model used in this analysis was trained on 8000 images; each image being either a cat or a dog. After the model was trained, it was tested to classify two images. It accurately classified the below images being that either of a cat or a dog.
